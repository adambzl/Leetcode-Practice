# Leetcode-Practice
My leetcode practices.

30 problems' solutions are grouped in one cpp file, named in the format of proXX_XX

the function name of a particular solution doesn't change, using the given name from leetcode

for most programs, following codes were added for speeding up:

static const auto speedup = [](){
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    return nullptr;
}();

practice.cpp file can be regarded as useless, I practice some other problems in that file:)
